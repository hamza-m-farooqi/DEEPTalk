❗clone this repo recursively using 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository_url>
```
or update submodules recursively using 
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
note that spectre requires `git-lfs` which can be installed by
```bash
conda install conda-forge::git-lfs
```
### Environment
Make environment and install pytorch
```bash
conda create -n deeptalk python=3.9
conda activate deeptalk
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```
Install pytorch3d and other requirements. Refer to this [page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for pytorch3d details.
```bash
pip install pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py39_cu113_pyt1121/download.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install osmesa and ffmpeg for headless rendering and audio, video processing. 
```bash
conda install menpo::osmesa
conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg
```
For trainig DEEPTalk on stage2, we used nvdiffrast.
Install nvdiffrast from [this repo](https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast.git
cd nvdiffrast
git checkout v0.3.1
python setup.py install
```

## 🛹 Inference
Run the following copmmand to make a video. Results will be saved in `./DEEPTalk/outputs`.
```
cd DEEPTalk
python demo.py --audio_path {raw audio file (.wav) or sampled audio (.npy)}
```

## 📚 Dataset 
### Download Data
Download MEAD Dataset from [here](https://github.com/uniBruce/Mead).

### Process Data
Use the reconstruction method from [EMOCAV2](https://github.com/radekd91/inferno) to reconstruct FLAME parameters from MEAD.

Leave an issue if your having troubles processing MEAD. We might be able to provide the exact parameters.


## 🏋️ Training
### 1. Train TH-VQVAE on MEAD FLAME parameters
Make a copy of `/DEEPTalk/checkpoint/TH-VQVAE/config_TH-VQVAE.json` and change the arguments like `data.data_dir` or `name` to train your own model.
Then run
```bash
cd DEEPTalk
python train_VQVAE.py --config {your config path}
```
### 2. Train DEEPTalk stage1
Make a copy of `/home/whwjdqls99/DEEPTalk/DEEPTalk/checkpoint/DEEPTalk/config_stage1.json` and change the arguments like `data.data_dir` or `name` to train your own model.
Then run
```bash
cd DEEPTalk
python train_DEEPTalk_stage1.py --DEEPTalk_config {your config path}
```
### 3. Train DEEPTalk stage2
Make a copy of `/home/whwjdqls99/DEEPTalk/DEEPTalk/checkpoint/DEEPTalk/config.json` and change the arguments like `data.data_dir` or `name` to train your own model.
Then run
```bash
cd DEEPTalk
python train_DEEPTalk_stage2.py --DEEPTalk_config {your config path} --checkpoint {stage1 trained model checkpoint path}
```
